## View
* `git clone` this
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Open http://localhost:9001/

## Develop
* `grunt watch` and/or `npm test`

## Todo
* Don't kill server on faulty results.js
* Do something about print view
* Disable walkthrough saving on server
* Review code slide headings - ensure lead slide is correct
* Introduce a timeout - results.html does not get cleaned up quickly enough!
